## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you’ve found a security issue in ModernPDO, please use the following procedure
instead of the normal bug reporting system. Send a message to the [owner](https://t.me/nnp666) in telegram.

For each report, we try to first confirm the vulnerability. Once confirmed,
the ModernPDO team will take the following actions:

* Acknowledge to the reporter that we’ve received the issue, and are
  working on a fix. We ask that the reporter keep the issue confidential until we announce it.
* Get a fix/patch prepared.
* Prepare a post describing the vulnerability, and the possible exploits.
* Release new versions of all affected versions.
* Prominently feature the problem in the release announcement
